Created the following function:
* `capitalize` takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized
* `reverseString` takes a string and returns it reversed
* `calculator` an object with `add`, `subtract`, `divide`, and `multiply` methods
* `caesarCipher` takes a string and returns a string with the characters shifted
* `analyzeArray` takes an array and returns an object with the following properties: `average`, `min`, `max`, and `length`

These function and objects were created with a test first design methodology.
